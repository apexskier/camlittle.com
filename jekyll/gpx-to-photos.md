GPX to Photos is an app I've written that allows you to geotag photos in your
Photos app directly from a GPX file or workout. It's really useful for photos
taken with my external camera that doesn't have a GPS.

[Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gpx-to-photos/id1403201208?ls=1)

The GPX to Photos app does not collect or share any personal information. Any
information shared off-device (such as crash reports) is managed by the
operating system and is subject to system wide data protection and settings.
