I’m a software engineer at [Remitly](https://grnh.se/3c4028751) where I’m
working on our apps and website. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science
from Western Washington University, where I worked for
[ResTek](http://restek.wwu.edu/about/jobs/). During the winter I ski, when
there’s water I’m on the river, and the rest of the time I hike.

I’ve got lots of projects, from Arduino, to mobile applications, to 3D
printing.

I'm [getting married](http://cameronandaisha.love)!

I can be contacted at: <cameron@camlittle.com> or
