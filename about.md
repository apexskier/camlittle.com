I’m the front-end developer at
[Remitly](https://www.remitly.com/us/en/home/careers) where I’m working on our
new web platform. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Western
Washington University, where I worked for
[ResTek](http://restek.wwu.edu/about/jobs/). During the winter I ski, when
there’s water I’m on the river, and the rest of the time I hike.

I’ve got lots of projects, from Arduino, to mobile applications, to 3D
printing.

I can be contacted at: <cameron@camlittle.com> or
