I’m currently attending Western Washington University, majoring in Computer
Science, and enrolled in the Honors program. I’m the Web Usability Coordinator
for Western's University Residences. During the winter I like to ski; I’ve
instructed at Mt Baker and coached at Apex Mountain Resort. In the summer I
whitewater kayak and raft guide, both on the Wenatchee and Elwha. I film and
edit videos of me and my friends doing cool things. I also make websites, like
the one you’re looking at now. I recently completed my first marathon, with a time
of 3:42.
