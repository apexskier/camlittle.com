Live Share is an app that allows you to export, edit, and create [Live
Photos](http://www.apple.com/iphone-6s/cameras/).

### Description

Share your Live Photos as GIFs or quicktime movies quickly and easily. Send
motion to friends using other platforms.

Tweak your Live Photos by trimming the video or changing the picture. Fix those
shots you missed by half a second.

Create Live Photos from videos or GIFs. Create custom slow motion live
wallpapers or use your favorite meme on your lock screen. Create and share,
even from older iPhones such as the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5C.

### Support

the info icon in the upper right and tap the "Wipe Generated Data" button.
