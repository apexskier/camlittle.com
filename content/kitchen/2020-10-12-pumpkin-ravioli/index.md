I made some fresh ravioli. It turned out great, but pasta is a lot easier with a pasta maker.

- 3 eggs
- 300g flour
- 1 small pumpkin like squash
- ~150g ricotta cheese
- fresh basil & rosemary, roughly chopped
- salt & pepper

### Filling

1. Cut the squash in half, coat with olive oil, roast at 200â„ƒ for about 45 minutes
2. Allow to cool, then scoop into a mixing bowl
3. Mix in ricotta, herbs, spices

### Pasta

1. Pour 300g of flour in a wide mixing bowl and make a well in the middle
2. Crack 3 eggs into flour
3. Mix (I start with a single chopstick, then move to my hands)
4. Knead by hand until smooth and an indentation made with your finger springs back
5. Split into thirds (100g of flour each), wrap in plastic, and let rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes

### Assembly

1. Roll out dough into a thin sheet (<1.5mm)
2. Plan out spacing for each ravioli, you want them to be an appropriate size with ~5mm of space on each edge
3. Spoon filling on dough
4. Fold dough over and press along edges of each piece of filling to seal
5. Cut into pieces
6. Crimp edges with fork

### Cooking

1. Bring pot of salted water to a boil
2. Boil ravioli for around 4 minutes, until pasta is done

Serve with your sauce of choice, browned butter goes especially well.
