Profiterols are fancy cream puffs made of choux pastry and filled with pastry cream. Choux pastry is notoriously tricky, and this was my first experience with it.

The website "The Flavor Bender" has a couple _great_ posts on each component, which were really helpful.

- [Creme Patissiere](https://www.theflavorbender.com/creme-patissiere-vanilla-pastry-cream/)

I actually have made these twice now. Both attempts went fairly well, but I haven't totally dialed in the pastry.

During my first attempt I opened the oven at the wrong time and half of my pastries deflated a bit. My second attempt's batter was too thin, so I didn't have as good of a shape while piping, but I was able to avoid deflation in the oven---leaving them to cool in the oven helped a lot.

My pastry cream turned out well, but I'd like it to be thicker---I had some splurting issues.
