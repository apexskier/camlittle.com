I sort of followed [this recipe for Grilled Mozzarella Sandwiches](https://www.marthastewart.com/315376/grilled-mozzarella-sandwiches) by Martha Stewart last night. We wanted to use the sourdough bread I'd baked in the morning to make grilled cheese, but didn't have great cheeses.

It's kind of like a cross between a grilled cheese and french toast.

I changed up the liquid dipped in with ~Â¼ cup melted butter, a bit of soy milk, an egg, and the nutmeg, thyme, and seasonings. The nutmeg was weird---I'd skip it in future.

I added mozzarella, some other stronger cheese we had, sliced cherry tomato, and dried basil inside.

Turned out pretty weird, but tasty.
