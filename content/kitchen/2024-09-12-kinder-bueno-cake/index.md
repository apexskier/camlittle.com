For Aisha's birthday this year she requested a Kinder Bueno inspired cake. Chocolate's a bit of an unusual request for her, so I knew it had to be good.

My base recipe is [one from Chelsweets](https://chelsweets.com/kinder-bueno-cake/): layers of shortbread, chocolate cake, hazelnut and white chocolate mouse, and a nutella frosting. The chocolate cake recipe was great!

I changed a few things:

- I made my shortbread from scratch, pressing into the bottom of my cake tins with a flat bottomed glass, then baking for around 20 minutes before pouring in my cake batter. This whole "cake baked directly on a cookie" was a first for me and worked very well.
- I swapped the American buttercream described in the original recipe for an Italian meringue buttercream, which is far superior. I had some issues with my buttercream deflating, but was able to rescue it (this seems to happen 4/5 times I do Italian meringue).
- I didn't have enough left in our Costco size box of real Kinder Bueno bars, so simplified the decorations.
