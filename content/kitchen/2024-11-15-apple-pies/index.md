Earlier in the summer a friend gave me about 20 pounds of apples from his tree. It was a good year for apples in Taos, and I've been making full use of our newly remodeled kitchen, so I wanted to avoid them going to waste.

I love pie, so I decided to do some holiday season prep. I baked down the apples with some white and brown sugar, cornstarch, water, and spices (mostly following [this recipe](https://happymoneysaver.com/freezer-apple-pie-filling/)) and bagged them into single-pie portions. A week or two later I made a couple batches of pie dough, baked off one pie, and froze the rest.

Super worth doing - as long as I remember to defrost, I can put together a fresh pie in 10 minutes or so + bake time.
