I've wanted to try baking with [aquafaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquafaba) (chickpea liquid) ever since I heard it could be used as a vegan egg substitute for baking.

It takes longer than egg white (but that may be my lack of a stand mixer) and is pretty magical once it starts forming peaks. Also: you don't have to figure out what to do with extra egg yolk.

The final product is spot-on to the texture and taste of the egg-based equivalent.

Next, I want to try aquafaba for a Genoise-style cake batter...
