This is a weird one. I was browsing desert recipes and stumbled upon this. It's basically poached meringue floating in a thin custard.

Although it's of French origin, apparently this is historically an American 4th of July tradition.

It's a pretty simple dish, but I wasn't able to get my custard to thicken at all. If I make this again, I'd change the recipe to do a caramel sauce instead of a hard caramel---the texture did not really work on top of the marshmallow-like meringue.
