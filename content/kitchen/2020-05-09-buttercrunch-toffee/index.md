  title: "Hazelnut buttercrunch toffee in a tupperware"
---

I've rarely done sugar work, but finally got a new thermometer over here in Poland. I swapped out almonds with 2:1 ratio of toasted hazelnuts and walnuts (I burnt my first set of nuts, they go fast!). Compared to the photos in the recipe, I had a lot more chocolate, but can't complain. I probably will go with ¼ to ½ less chocolate next time.

Very tasty!
