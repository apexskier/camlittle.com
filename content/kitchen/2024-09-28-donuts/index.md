I was commissioned to make donuts for a friends wedding party. I convinced them that donuts are best as fresh as can be, so I prepped dough the night before and did cold-ferment before getting up early to fry and glaze.

I pretty much followed Serious Eats recipe directly, though I had to adjust for altitude. The last time I made donuts at altitude (Crested Butte for my sister-in-laws wedding party) I forgot my thermometer and had to gauge temp using a chopstick. This time, I looked it up properly and found I need to reduce my oil temp by 21â„‰, since I'm at 7000 feet, which worked perfectly.
