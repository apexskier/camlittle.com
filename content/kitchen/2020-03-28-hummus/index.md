### Recipe:

1. Add two cloves raw garlic to food processor and pulse
2. Add 1 can drained garbanzo beans, olive oil (~¼–½ cup), salt (~¼ teaspoon), black pepper, ~¼ teaspoon paprika (optional).
3. Blend until creamy, adding more olive oil as needed
4. Taste and adjust seasoning

Be careful not to over salt. The raw garlic goes a long way.
