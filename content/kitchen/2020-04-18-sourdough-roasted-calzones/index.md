I threw together a 50% hydration sourdough, proofed for 4 or 5 hours, then deflated and rolled into sheets.

While waiting, I made a roasted tomato sauce: 1 can diced tomatoes, a few tablespoons tomato paste, a small diced onion, and a few cloves of garlic. Saute until reduced, then roast in the oven at ~170℃ for 40 minutes.

Before prepping, I roasted brocoli and bell peppers for 30 minutes, sauted button mushrooms and onions, and seasoned everything.

Then I wrapped everything up in my dough, crimped the edges well, brushed with egg wash, and baked for around 35 minutes at 230℃.
