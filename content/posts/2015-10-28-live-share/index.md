Live Share is an app that allows you to export, edit, and create [Live
Photos](http://www.apple.com/iphone-6s/cameras/).

Edit: I've since abandoned this, but you can [view the code on GitHub](https://github.com/apexskier/LiveGifs).

### Description

Share your Live Photos as GIFs or quicktime movies quickly and easily. Send
motion to friends using other platforms.

Tweak your Live Photos by trimming the video or changing the picture. Fix those
shots you missed by half a second.

Create Live Photos from videos or GIFs. Create custom slow motion live
wallpapers or use your favorite meme on your lock screen. Create and share,
even from older iPhones such as the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5C.

### Support

This app is under active development, and may contain a few bugs. Tweet
[@apexskier](https://twitter.com/apexskier) with any issues.

You can try deleting data from the app if things are behaving badly. Just tap
the info icon in the upper right and tap the "Wipe Generated Data" button.

### Privacy Policy

Live Share does not store any of your photos or videos outside of your device
and claims no ownership or liability for them. Your media will not be shared
with anyone. You use the app at your own risk; by using it you imply consent to
the information on this page even if it changes. Some anonymous information is
automatically collected by the developers and Apple for analytics and to
