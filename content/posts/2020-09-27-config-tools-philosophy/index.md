- portability
   - examples
	   - vim keybindings
	   - bash
	   - limited aliases
   - why
       - freedom to switch tools (e.g. vim to atom to vscode to ...)
	   - helping other people (I can sit down on their machine, when demoing they can follow along without setup)
- visibility
   - better UI doesn't prevent portability
- unix philosophy
   - small tools
   - operate on common formats (text)
- speed
   - i work fast
   - typing is faster than the computer can think
