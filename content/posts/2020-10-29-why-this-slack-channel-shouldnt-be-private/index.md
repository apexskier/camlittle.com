Here's why you shouldn't use a private Slack channel:

1. Messages are not [searchable](https://slack.com/intl/en-pl/help/articles/202528808-Search-in-Slack) once you leave
2. Messages are not [sharable](https://slack.com/intl/en-pl/help/articles/203274767-Share-messages-in-Slack)
3. People can't easily jump in and out
4. You can't notify someone when you [mention them](https://slack.com/intl/en-pl/help/articles/205240127-Use-mentions-in-Slack)
5. Workspace apps and bots aren't present
6. They cultivate an ["Us vs. them" culture](https://www.forbes.com/sites/duenablomstrom1/2019/02/06/why-a-culture-of-us-vs-them-is-deadly/)
7. They foster unconscious biases by making it easy to exclude people
8. You can't change your mind and make a private channel public

While there are uses for private channels, they hinder communication and transparency. Please make public channels your default.
