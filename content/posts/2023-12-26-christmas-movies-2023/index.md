My wife and I (and her parents) tend to watch a lot of Christmas movies this time of year. Here are my rankings of those we got to this year:

### <time datetime="2023-12-13">12/13</time> - [The Claus Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Claus_Family)

Especially considering the _two_ sequels, not very good. Pretty unconvincing and to-be-expected storylines, both about Santa Claus and saving the biscuit factory. The humor wasn't great either, but this was probably made worse by watching a dub.

★☆☆☆☆

### <time datetime="2023-12-16">12/16</time> - [Family Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Switch)

Family _Freaky Friday_, but not as good. Tenuous connection to Christmas. Lots of writing that had the appearance of jokes.

★☆☆☆☆

### <time datetime="2023-12-16">12/16</time> - [Love Hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Hard)

Pretty good Christmas romantic comedy. The writing and acting were quite good in general, and the characters had more dimension than most rom-coms, especially Josh.

★★★★☆

### <time datetime="2023-12-17">12/17</time> - [Holiday in the Vineyards](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/holiday_in_the_vineyards)

Pretty standard Hallmark-style Christmas romantic comedy, meaning not much comedy and a stretched connection to Christmas (who has a real estate deadline on Christmas Eve?). The son of a fancy wine company has to sneak around a small town to get inside info on buying the vineyard. Falls in love with a sexy local wine lady, and has to reveal his lies. Some gratuitous shirtless abs, and way too public sexy dancing.

★★☆☆☆

### <time datetime="2023-12-18">12/18</time> - [Christmas with You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_with_You_(film))

A slight deviation from the standard format, an aging pop star surprises a fan for the holidays, falls in love with the dad, and writes a hit Christmas song with him. Not terrible, but not one I need to watch again.

★★★☆☆

### <time datetime="2023-12-25">12/25</time> - [Candy Cane Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Cane_Lane_(film))

This one was a wild ride. A neighborhood's Christmas decoration contest escalates dramatically. This one was laugh-out-loud funny and I found the animation for the figurines quite effective.

★★★★★
