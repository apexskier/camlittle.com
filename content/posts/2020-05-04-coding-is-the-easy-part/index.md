Thoughts around types of "software development"

Writing code is one type.

Technical design is another.

Writing code is "easier" in some ways, since the effort is not 100% in the developers head. IDE, language features, exceptions all provide direction and structure to help the process of writing code.

Simple refactors and code deletion can feel "refreshing" because they don't require hard thinking.

Technical design is harder, since it (should be) implementation decoupled. This means closer to 100% of the effort is in the mental process of the developer. You can't lean on tooling to tell you when you're doing something wrong or what to think about next.
