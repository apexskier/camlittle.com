I made some lightsabers with CSS and Javascript. You can [play with them](/lightsaber). Space will open and close them and arrow keys will switch between them while deactivated.
They work on modern browsers, but motions are broken in Firefox. Sounds were lost when I recovered them from my old server, ~~though if I get around to it I might try to reenable them~~.
