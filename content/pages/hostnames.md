I've been using a system for naming my devices several years now, starting from when I learned about computer naming schemes at ResTek[^1]. I've taken inspiration from [RFC 1178 - "Choosing a Name for Your Computer"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178)[^2].

This page exists to document my current and historical names.

I name each of my computers after [Washington rivers](https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/state-summary/state/WA/), and generally try to group them by device type via starting letter.

[^1]: When I worked there, the server admins had started using Norse gods, and apparently a previous generation had used Sesame Street characters.

[^2]: Yep, there's an RFC for this. Another great one is [RFC 1855](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855)
