Iâ€™m a software engineer at [Remitly](https://grnh.se/3c4028751), where Iâ€™m
working on our international product team. I've lived in
[KrakÃ³w, Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±](https://aackleinkrakow.blogspot.com) since September 2019 with
[my wife](https://cameronandaisha.love) to help start our new European
engineering office. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Western
Washington University, where I worked for
[ResTek](https://www.restek.wwu.edu/about/jobs/). I like spending time outside
[running long distances](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14856714) and
[wilderness backpacking](https://www.gaiagps.com/profile/13832/Cameron/).

I have [lots of](/tags/project/) [projects](/projects/) across a variety of
domains and technologies. My favorite things to build are tools that solve
specific problems and are created with close attention to detail.

My handle across most social media is `apexskier`, which a few people have asked me about: In middle and high school, my family lived at a small ski resort called [Apex](https://www.apexresort.com). Around this time, I created my first few online accounts and chose the username.
