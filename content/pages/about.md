Iâ€™ve been a software developer at [Remitly](https://www.remitly.com/home/about) since 2015, where I build tools to help our development teams scale. I lived in [KrakÃ³w, Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±](https://aackleinkrakow.blogspot.com) from late 2019 to 2021 with [my wife](https://aishalittle.com), where I helped found Remitly's first European engineering office. I was able to join our IPO celebration in New York just after moving back to the US. Shortly after moving back to the US, I flew to New York to [celebrate Remitly's IPO](https://content.camlittle.com/90550116-mo_092321216.jpeg) by ringing Nasdaq's opening bell.

I graduated from Western Washington University in 2015, where I worked for [ResTek](https://web.archive.org/web/20150423102116/http://restek.wwu.edu/).

I like spending time outside [running long distances](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14856714) and [wilderness backpacking](https://www.gaiagps.com/profile/13832/Cameron/).


I have [lots of](/tags/project/) [projects](/projects/) across a variety of domains and technologies. My favorite things to build are tools that solve specific problems and are created with close attention to detail.
