Iâ€™m a software developer at [Remitly](https://www.remitly.com/home/about), where
I build tools to help our development teams scale. I moved to 
[KrakÃ³w, Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±](https://aackleinkrakow.blogspot.com) in September 2019 with
[my wife](https://aishalittle.com) to help found Remitly's European engineering
office. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Western Washington
University, where I worked for
[ResTek](https://web.archive.org/web/20150423102116/http://restek.wwu.edu/).
I like spending time outside
[running long distances](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14856714) and
[wilderness backpacking](https://www.gaiagps.com/profile/13832/Cameron/).

I have [lots of](/tags/project/) [projects](/projects/) across a variety of
domains and technologies. My favorite things to build are tools that solve
specific problems and are created with close attention to detail.
