Iâ€™m a software engineer at [Remitly](https://grnh.se/3c4028751), where Iâ€™m
working on our international product team. I've lived in
[KrakÃ³w, Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±](https://aackleinkrakow.blogspot.com) since September 2019 with
[my wife](https://cameronandaisha.love) to help start our new European
engineering office. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Western
Washington University, where I worked for
[ResTek](https://www.restek.wwu.edu/about/jobs/). I like spending time outside
[running long distances](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14856714) and
[wilderness backpacking](https://www.gaiagps.com/profile/13832/Cameron/).

I have [lots of](/tags/project/) [projects](/projects/) across a variety of
domains and technologies. My favorite things to build are tools that solve
specific problems and are created with close attention to detail.
