I’m a software engineer at [Remitly](https://grnh.se/3c4028751) where I’m
working on our international product team. I recently moved to
[Kraków, Poland](https://aackleinkrakow.blogspot.com) with
[my wife](https://cameronandaisha.love) to help start our new European
engineering office. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Western
Washington University, where I worked for
[ResTek](https://www.restek.wwu.edu/about/jobs/). I like spending time outside
[running long distances](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14856714) and
[wilderness backpacking](https://www.gaiagps.com/profile/13832/Cameron/).

I have [lots of](/tags/project/) [projects](/projects/) across a variety of
domains and technologies. My favorite things to build are tools that solve
specific problems and are built with a high attention to detail.

I can be contacted at: <cameron@camlittle.com>.

My handle across most social media is `apexskier`, which a few people have asked me about. In middle and high school, my family lived at a small ski resort called [Apex](https://www.apexresort.com). Around this time I created my first few online accounts, and chose the username.
