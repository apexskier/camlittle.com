I’m a software engineer at [Remitly](https://grnh.se/3c4028751) where I’m
working on our international product team. I recently moved to
[Kraków, Poland](https://aackleinkrakow.blogspot.com) with
[my wife](https://cameronandaisha.love) to help start our new European
engineering office. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Western
Washington University, where I worked for
[ResTek](https://www.restek.wwu.edu/about/jobs/). I like spending time outside
[running long distances](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14856714) and
[wilderness backpacking](https://www.gaiagps.com/profile/13832/Cameron/).

I have lots of projects, ranging from web, iOS, and macOS applications,
Arduino, and 3D printing.

I can be contacted at: <cameron@camlittle.com>.
