These are some of the tools I use and like, and some notes on how I configure them.

First, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/apexskier/dotfiles) contain a ton of configuration, and are how I automatically synchronize most of my terminal and macOS preferences.

### Editor

My current editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [vim emulation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim). I'm also exploring using [Nova](https://panic.com/nova/) from panic, but don't see it becoming my primary editor without vim keybindings.

### Desktop Apps

- [1Password](https://1password.com/) - password manager
- [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) - keeps my computer from falling asleep
- [Default Browser](https://apexskier.github.io/DefaultBrowser/) - my own tool for managing my default browser
- [Gifski](https://sindresorhus.com/gifski) - High quality gif encoder
- [Gitup](https://gitup.co) - visual git tool, I mostly use the history view
