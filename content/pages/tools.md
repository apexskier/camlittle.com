These are some of the tools I use and like, and some notes on how I configure them.

First, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/apexskier/dotfiles) contain a ton of configuration, and are how I automatically synchronize most of my terminal and macOS preferences. It also contains the apps I install on [macOS](https://github.com/apexskier/dotfiles/blob/master/homebrew/Brewfile) and [linux](https://github.com/apexskier/dotfiles/blob/master/linux/install.sh).

### Editor

I've been using [vim](https://www.vim.org) since college and I'm pretty dependent on it. It's my go to for quick changes.

My current graphical editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [vim emulation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) (make sure to set up the [cli tool](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line)). I'm also exploring using [Nova](https://panic.com/nova/) from panic, but don't see it becoming my primary editor without vim keybindings.
