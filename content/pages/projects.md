## Some less useful side projects

[Wedding Website](https://cameronandaisha.love)
: circa 2019. A website I built for my wedding. There's some fancy nginx config behind the scenes to support a few domain names: [cameronandaisha.love](https://cameronandaisha.love), [aishaandcameron.love](https://aishaandcameron.love), and [ourlittlewedding.love](https://ourlittlewedding.love). I built a custom photobooth on a Raspberry Pi that automatically printed photo strips for our guests and put them on the site. I also built a custom email distribution and tracking system to send RSVP and reminder emails, which I might open source in the future. <small>[website source](https://github.com/apexskier/ourlittlewedding)</small> <small>[photobooth source](https://github.com/apexskier/photobooth)</small>
